# Camden Multi-Model Ensemble Configuration Example
#
# This configuration demonstrates how to use multiple ONNX models for improved
# content moderation accuracy through ensemble classification.

models_dir = ".vendor/models"
ort_library = ".vendor/onnxruntime/lib/onnxruntime.dll"

# ENSEMBLE MODE: Specify multiple moderation models
# Results are aggregated using averaging by default
moderation_models = [
    "gantman-nsfw",          # 5-class baseline model (InceptionV3, 89MB)
    "vladmandic-nudenet",    # Body part detection (12MB)
    "adamcodd-vit-nsfw",     # ViT-based high accuracy (344MB)
]

# TAGGING ENSEMBLE MODE: Specify multiple tagging models
# Tags from all models are merged and confidence scores averaged
tagging_models = [
    "mobilenetv2",           # Lightweight ImageNet (1000 classes)
    "vit-base-224-q8",       # Vision Transformer (quantized)
]

# OR use single models (backward compatible):
# tagging_model = "mobilenetv2"
# moderation_model = "gantman-nsfw"

# Alternative ensemble configurations:
#
# Option 1: Lightweight (2 models, ~100MB) - Recommended ⭐
# moderation_models = ["gantman-nsfw", "vladmandic-nudenet"]
#
# Option 2: Balanced (3 models, ~445MB)
# moderation_models = [
#     "gantman-nsfw",
#     "vladmandic-nudenet",
#     "adamcodd-vit-nsfw",
# ]
#
# Option 3: High-accuracy (4 models, ~545MB)
# moderation_models = [
#     "gantman-nsfw",
#     "adamcodd-vit-nsfw",
#     "vladmandic-nudenet",
#     "spiele-nsfw",
# ]
#
# Option 4: ViT-focused ensemble
# moderation_models = [
#     "adamcodd-vit-nsfw",
#     "onnx-community-nsfw",
# ]

# How ensemble aggregation works:
# - Average: Averages probability scores across all models (default)
# - MaxTier: Uses the most restrictive tier from any model (most conservative)
#
# The ensemble runs all models in parallel and combines their predictions
# for more robust and accurate content moderation results.
